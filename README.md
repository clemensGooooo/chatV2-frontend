## What's that?

That's the front end of the chat app, for the web.
The app is not finally touched, there are many things not really implementet, but I will keep working, I hope you can take some advise from this app to create your own -:)

If you need more info how this works you can read the main `README.md`

Thanks for reading this Clemens!
