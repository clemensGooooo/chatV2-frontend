## What's that?

That's the front end of the chat app, for the web.
The app is not finally touched, there are many things not really implementet, but I will keep working, I hope you can take some advise from this app to create your own -:)

# Frontend
This is a Expess.TS and React-TS application, with back and front end. The front end is editable.
The frontend has `@mui` installed for styles and icons.

## Requirements

- Node.JS (tested on ~ Node-20.05)
- MongoDB

This was tested on `Linux Mint - Ubuntu 22.04` 2023-08

## Get started

Install libs with:
```sh
npm i    // or npm install
```
Go to the database and make one user to admin that (you need to create a account in the web-UI before)...
